# AgenSea

## What this is

BSC has **322,974** registered AI agents. **4,353** have ever had a client.
(Both figures from `registry_stats`, measured 31 Aug 2026.)

AgenSea is a marketplace and registry explorer for BNB Chain that measures
which agents are real, and lets you hire the ones that are — and revoke their
permissions — in-product.

## What we measured

Every figure below carries the `measured_at` of the sweep it came from — the
same date the site prints next to each number. Percentages marked *derived*
are computed from those measured values.

- **322,974** ERC-8004 agents minted on BSC mainnet (chain 56) — measured 31 Aug 2026
- **The registry grows ~3,095 agents/day** (*derived*: +5,506 minted between the
  29 Aug 20:53 UTC and 31 Aug 15:36 UTC sweeps) — while the number that have
  ever had a client did not move
- **4,353** have ever had a client — 1.35% of minted and falling (*derived*) —
  measured 31 Aug 2026
- **The fan-out collapse:** those 4,353 agents' **8,265** client relationships come
  from only **108** distinct client addresses, and the top two addresses alone
  account for **35.5%** of all edges (1,800 + 1,137 = 2,937; *derived*).
  Reputation on the registry traces to a small set of payers.
- **B402 Bazaar:** **978** resources from **7** payees, one payee holding
  **96.22%** of the catalogue — measured 31 Aug 2026
- **Exactly one** agent address appears in both datasets — measured 31 Aug 2026
- **The Studio path reaches our index:** an agent scaffolded with BNB Agent
  Studio, deployed to AWS AgentCore and registered with `bag erc8004 register`,
  is in the registry we sweep — agent **341493** on chain 56, owner
  `0xCBEF…e002`, indexed 18:43 UTC on 8 Sep 2026. It is a **scaffold running the
  default free model**: it does no useful work, and it exists only to test the
  registry path end to end. It is not hireable through AgenSea — our hire path
  is on 97.

### Cross-checked against 8004scan (surveyed 1 Sep 2026)

We compared our sweep with [8004scan](https://8004scan.io), a third-party
ERC-8004 explorer, on chain 56:

- **They index 295,734 BSC agents against our 322,974** measured from chain —
  8.4% behind.
- **Their API never returns “no data.”** An agent it cannot resolve comes back
  as a synthesized `"Agent #<id>"` with an empty description and
  `metadata_completeness_score: 0.0` — indistinguishable from real metadata
  unless you check for it. We asked them for **all 908** of our agents that
  have a client but no metadata of their own:

  | | agents | share |
  |---|---:|---:|
  | real metadata, stored | 136 | 15.0% |
  | **synthesized `Agent #<id>` placeholder, rejected** | **730** | **80.4%** |
  | blank name, rejected | 31 | 3.4% |
  | name only, nothing behind it, rejected | 11 | 1.2% |

  A 40-agent pre-sample had predicted 52% placeholders. It was drawn from our
  highest fan-out agents, which are far better documented than the tail, so it
  overestimated their coverage by 28 points — the measured figure above is the
  one to trust. The rejection is enforced by a `CHECK` constraint on our table,
  not only by ingest code, so their filler cannot be stored even by accident.
- **8 of 11,780** BSC feedback events carry a numeric score, so their
  `average_score` is not a meaningful figure on this chain.

The units are not the same and we do not treat them as such: our client count
is `getClients()` read live from the ReputationRegistry; theirs is an indexed
feedback event. These are two different quantities, not one quantity measured
twice — which is also why our 4,353 agents-with-a-client and their 582
agents-with-feedback are not a contradiction.

## What we built

Four first-party agents on BSC testnet (chain 97), one per BNB category, each
with completed ERC-8183 jobs whose deliverable hashes are verifiable on chain:

| Agent | Agent id | Category | A completed job |
|---|---|---|---|
| Venus Health Factor Monitor | 2012 | health-factor-monitoring | 795 |
| PancakeSwap V3 Rebalancing Monitor | 2013 | rebalancing | 796 |
| Grid Trading Parameter Advisor | 2014 | grid-trading | 754 |
| BSC Yield Route Optimiser | 2015 | yield-optimisation | 797 |

Verify one yourself: `bash scripts/verify_deliverable.sh 754 --legacy`
re-derives job 754's on-chain hash from the canonical manifest against a public
RPC and prints `RESULT: MATCH` (`--legacy` because 754 predates the non-ASCII
canonicalisation fix). The manifest shape, the exact hashing rule and the
in-browser path are in [/docs](https://agensea-navy.vercel.app/docs#how-to-verify).

- **Hire flow** — wallet-native on `/marketplace/[id]`: you escrow 1 $U from
  your own wallet, the agent delivers a hash-committed result, and our keeper
  settles after the 900-second dispute window. Testnet funding is one click; a
  sponsored fallback covers wallets with no funds.
  ([the five transactions, step by step](https://agensea-navy.vercel.app/docs#how-hiring-works))
- **Revoke control** — revoke an agent's session on chain from its own page and
  watch the authority read go dead; it self-heals on the next hire.
  ([what a session key can and cannot do](https://agensea-navy.vercel.app/docs#session-keys))
- **Per track**: main — the live marketplace (categories, hire, revoke);
  Altana — session keys granted, scoped, revoked and healed on chain
  (`/marketplace/2012`, session panel); TermiX —
  [AGENT_ADVANTAGE_REPORT.md](AGENT_ADVANTAGE_REPORT.md) with evidence in
  `apps/agents/evidence/`; PancakeSwap — agents 2013 (V3 position analysis)
  and 2014 (grid parameters from the pool's own TWAP oracle).
- **Mainnet identity** — the Venus Health Factor Monitor is also registered in
  the BSC MAINNET (56) ERC-8004 IdentityRegistry: agentId **322885**,
  [tx 0x381cff97…](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x381cff9788d7c6866f56609035a49fa9dca78ed01540884b0557beec4b377807),
  byte-identical metadata. Jobs, sessions and escrow are demonstrated on
  testnet 97 — no mainnet jobs exist.

## Upstream issues filed

Authored by `shrooms08` (GitHub shows the authorship). **Five findings filed,
three fixed** — #57, #58 and #59 all shipped in `@altananetwork/sdk` **0.9.0**,
published 2 Sep 2026. The two open ones are against `bnb-chain/bnbagent-sdk`.

**Two of the three merges cite our own on-chain transactions as their
verification.** [#66](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/pull/66)
confirmed our raised-cap retry at **block 127877832** before writing code, and
replayed our bundle to show it still returned `{status: 300, receipts: []}` days
later — permanently terminal, not pending.
[#68](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/pull/68) cites our `submit`
through generic `execute` at **block 127889442** as its evidence that the
`submit(uint256,bytes32,bytes)` selector works in the deployed kernel.

Both blocks are on chain 97, and both were re-read here against the seed node
rather than taken from the PRs: 127877832 is timestamped 29 Aug 08:17:55 UTC and
we filed #57 at 08:21:37 — under four minutes later. 127889442 is 09:44:59 and
#59 was filed at 09:46:39, a hundred seconds after. Each transaction is the one
that produced the report it is cited in.

[#67](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/pull/67) took the third route:
it ran our repro and found a failure mode **we had not reported** —
`JSON.stringify` *throws* on any session carrying a spend cap, because the
limits are bigints. So the documented "persist the Session verbatim" advice
failed three ways, not the two we described.

- [altana-sdk #57](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/issues/57) —
  `waitForCalls` hangs for the full 240 s timeout on unmapped relay status 300.
  **Fixed upstream in [#66](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/pull/66)**,
  merged 2 Sep 2026: relay statuses are classified by EIP-5792 band, so a
  rejection fails in ~355 ms with `statusCode` attached instead of returning a
  wrong `PENDING` after four minutes. The PR replayed our bundle (still
  `{status: 300, receipts: []}` days later) and confirmed our raised-cap retry
  on chain at block 127877832.
- [altana-sdk #58](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/issues/58) —
  docs say to persist the `Session` object verbatim, but `JSON.stringify` drops
  `signDigest` and keeps `_privateKey`.
  **Fixed upstream in [#67](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/pull/67)**,
  merged 2 Sep 2026: `serializeSession` / `deserializeSession` helpers,
  `_privateKey` made non-enumerable so no spread or stringify can capture it,
  and the advice rewritten in all eight places. Running our repro also turned up
  a third failure we had not reported — `JSON.stringify` *throws* on any session
  carrying a spend cap, because the limits are bigints.
- [altana-sdk #59](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/issues/59) —
  no ERC-8183 seller path: the SDK could hire and settle but not submit a
  deliverable. **Filed; fixed upstream in
  [altana-sdk #68](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/pull/68)**,
  merged 1 Sep 2026, which adds `submitErc8183Deliverable`, `buildSubmitCall`,
  `erc8183SubmitPermissions` and a manifest codec. Our manifest and submit path
  in `apps/agents/src/erc8183` exists because the SDK had none when we built
  it; that gap is now closed upstream. The PR cites our own submit transaction
  through generic `execute` (chain 97, block 127889442) as its on-chain
  confirmation that the `submit(uint256,bytes32,bytes)` selector works, and
  credits the cross-language hash trap we reported — which it found in its own
  demo script: a hand-rolled canonicaliser missing the `\uXXXX` escaping,
  hashing a report containing an em dash. It shipped in 0.9.0 on 2 Sep; we are
  on `^0.8.0` and have not migrated, six days from submission. Independent
  corroboration that the gap was real and general, not our misreading: BNB Agent
  Studio's own seller hand-rolls its deliverable submit in
  `app/agent/src/signing.ts` rather than calling the SDK, and pins
  `@altananetwork/sdk@0.7.1`.
- [bnb-chain/bnbagent-sdk #82](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bnbagent-sdk/issues/82) —
  jobId race: provider + status cannot identify your own job, so a losing racer
  can submit a valid-hash deliverable for the wrong task (the hire route guards
  against this by re-reading the job's description after funding)
- [bnb-chain/bnbagent-sdk #86](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bnbagent-sdk/issues/86) —
  the BNB Agent Studio buyer skill (`buying-via-8183.md`) documents a 24 h
  ERC-8183 dispute window in six places, one of them labelled a *protocol fact*.
  `disputeWindow()` on the policies that `config.py` itself ships returns **900 s
  on chain 97** and **604,800 s on chain 56** — neither is 24 h, and the error
  runs in opposite directions, so no single constant fixes it. A buyer following
  the doc idles a day on a testnet job that was settleable in fifteen minutes,
  and on mainnet approves six days early into a revert. Same class as
  [altana-sdk #53](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/issues/53): a
  shipped constant the deployed contract contradicts. Both windows re-read here
  before filing; the 900 s figure is the one `/docs` renders.

Confirmed on chain, not authored by us:

- [altana-sdk #53](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/issues/53)
  (filed by an altana-sdk maintainer) — `ERC8183_ADDRESSES[97].policy` is not
  whitelisted on the EvaluatorRouter. We verified the failure independently via
  `router.policyWhitelist()` reads; see footgun 4 below. Closed 1 Sep 2026, and
  0.9.0 ships the whitelisted address — verified by unpacking the published
  tarball: `0xd6a42175…` is present and the broken `0x4F4678D4…` is gone.

## Engineering notebook

The rest of this file is the engineering notebook: SDK footguns, relay-fee
measurements, Venus decoding, and the sweep runbook — where the submission
ends and the working notes begin.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in. Nothing in `.env` is ever printed
by any script in this repo; probes mask secrets before writing findings.

### `ALTANA_CHAIN=97` — required, and a genuine footgun

**Both the Altana MCP server and the SDK default to BNB MAINNET (chain 56) when
the network is unset.** In `@altananetwork/mcp` the resolution is literally:

```ts
const NETWORK = NETWORKS[requestedChain as keyof typeof NETWORKS] ?? BNB;
```

An unset or misspelled value silently selects mainnet, where transactions move
real value. Nothing in the log distinguishes it beyond one banner line.

Register the MCP server with the chain pinned explicitly:

```bash
claude mcp add altana -e ALTANA_CHAIN=97 -- bunx @altananetwork/mcp
```

Confirm the banner on startup:

```
[altana-mcp] network: BNB Smart Chain Testnet (chainId 97)
```

Config alone is not enough, because config drifts silently. Every agent entry
point calls `assertChain97()` from `apps/agents/src/chain-guard.ts`, which
reads `eth_chainId` **back off the wire** from the RPC the client is actually
configured with and throws `WrongChainError` unless it is 97. It runs before any
signer is constructed. Do not remove it, and do not weaken it to a config read.

### `AGENT_KEY`

Admin signer for the Altana smart account. **Testnet key only.** Read from
`.env`, never logged. The smart account address equals the signer address: the
account is an EIP-7702 delegated EOA, not a separate contract address.

## The relay bills the account — it does not sponsor gas

This is easy to get backwards. Altana's relay *submits* transactions, so the
`from` on every receipt is a relay-operated address rather than your account.
It does not follow that gas is free. The relay charges the smart account a fee
in native tBNB, and the account must be funded or execution fails.

Measured on BSC testnet (chain 97):

| Operation | Fee charged to the account | L1 gas used by the relay submitter |
|---|---|---|
| `grantSession` (+ KeyStore registration) | ~0.00087 tBNB | 967,880 gas (first, incl. account registration) |
| `execute` one call through a session key | **0.0000324 tBNB** | 199,484 gas |
| `revokeSession` | ~0.00003 tBNB | 154,259 gas |

The account-side fee and the L1 gas are different numbers; size spend caps
against the **fee**, not against gas.

Mainnet (chain 56), one observation: the first `execute` (register + 7702
delegation + KeyStore registration, batched) cost **0.000879383 BNB** against
1,387,882 gas at 0.05 gwei — a **12.7× markup over raw gas** [M, one
observation]. The absolute fee lands almost exactly on the testnet
first-execute figure (~0.00087) even though mainnet quotes a live rate
(`constantRate: null`) where testnet pins 1.0.

### Spend caps must cover the relay fee

A session's `SpendPermission` on the native token is what pays that fee. A cap
below it makes the session unusable even for a call that transfers no value:

```ts
// BROKEN: requestTokens() sends no value, but the session still cannot pay
// the ~3.2e13 wei relay fee. The bundle is accepted and never mined.
spend: [{ limit: 1n, period: 'hour' }]

// WORKS
spend: [{ limit: 10_000_000_000_000_000n, period: 'hour' }]  // 0.01 tBNB
```

## SDK footguns

Three behaviours that cost us real debugging time. All confirmed against
`@altananetwork/sdk` 0.8.0 on chain 97.

### 1. Mainnet is the silent default

Covered above under `ALTANA_CHAIN`. Unset or misspelled selects chain 56.

### 2. Spend caps must cover the relay fee

Covered above. A cap below the relay fee makes a session unusable even for a
call that transfers no value, and the bundle is accepted then never mined.

**The surfacing is fixed upstream**, in
[altana-sdk#66](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/pull/66) (merged
2 Sep 2026, shipped in 0.9.0): relay statuses are classified by EIP-5792 band,
so a rejection now fails in about 355 ms with `statusCode: 300` attached instead
of a 240-second hang ending in a wrong `PENDING`. **On 0.8.0 you still get the
hang.** The sizing rule is unchanged either way — the cap must cover the relay
fee, and 0.9.0 adds a `grantSession` warning saying so, because a fast, correct
error still leaves you with a session that cannot transact.

### 3. `grantSession` silently generates an ephemeral session signer

If you do not pass `sessionSigner`, the SDK generates one and returns it on the
`Session`. It exists **only in process memory**. Let the process exit without
persisting it and you are left with a registered, live, on-chain permission
whose key no longer exists anywhere. We did exactly this and had to revoke and
re-grant.

The documented remedy — "Persist the `Session` object verbatim" — is not
followable, because `Session.signer` carries a `signDigest` closure:

```js
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(signer))
// keeps:  type, address, publicKey, _privateKey   <-- raw key written to your store
// drops:  signDigest                              <-- restored object cannot sign
```

So the naive persist writes the secret to disk *and* loses the capability.

**Fixed upstream** in
[altana-sdk#67](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/pull/67) (merged
2 Sep 2026, shipped in 0.9.0): there are now `serializeSession` /
`deserializeSession` helpers, `_privateKey` is non-enumerable so no stringify or
spread can capture it, and `grantSession` warns when called without a
`sessionSigner` — the exact combination that stranded us. **On 0.8.0 every word
above still applies.** Re-running our repro upstream also found a third failure
we had not reported: `JSON.stringify` *throws* on any session carrying a spend
cap, because the limits are bigints — so the documented advice failed three
ways, not two.

The habit below is worth keeping regardless of version: supplying your own
signer means the key's lifetime is a decision you made, not a side effect of
whether a helper happened to persist it.

**Always supply and persist your own session signer:**

```ts
import { generatePrivateKey } from 'viem/accounts';
import { signerFromPrivateKey } from '@altananetwork/sdk';

const sessionKey = generatePrivateKey();
const sessionSigner = signerFromPrivateKey(sessionKey);

// .secrets/ is gitignored; dir 0700, file 0600. NOT /tmp — macOS clears it on
// reboot and periodically otherwise, which reproduces the lost-key failure.
mkdirSync(SECRETS, { recursive: true, mode: 0o700 });
writeFileSync(resolve(SECRETS, 'session.key'), sessionKey, { mode: 0o600 });

const session = await client.grantSession({
  wallet, signer: adminSigner, sessionSigner,   // <-- never omit this
  permissions: { calls, spend }, expiry, register: true,
});
```

Persist the serialisable half separately — `walletAddress`, `publicKey`,
`permissions`, `expiry` — and rebuild the signer from the stored key on boot.

Revocation does **not** need the session signer: `revokeSession` accepts
`Session | Hex` (the public key) and is signed by the admin. A lost session key
is recoverable by revoking, not by resigning yourself to it.

### 4. `ERC8183_ADDRESSES[97].policy` is not whitelisted

The policy the SDK ships for chain 97 (`0x4F4678D4439feC812Ac7674Bb3Efb4C8f5Fb78A6`)
is not whitelisted on the EvaluatorRouter. Every hire reverts at `registerJob`
with `PolicyNotWhitelisted()` — selector `0xc94463e3`. The working address is
`0xd6a4217588F6B1F5657a92A3e94E6422aD771cEA`, confirmed three ways: the router's
own `policyWhitelist()` read, the operator manifest in
`bnb-chain/bnbagent-sdk/networks/addresses.py`, and upstream issue
[#53](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/issues/53).

**Fixed upstream: 0.9.0 ships the correct address.** Unpacking the published
tarball, `0xd6a42175…` is what it exports and `0x4F4678D4…` is gone. **On 0.8.0
the broken address is still what you get**, which is why the override below
exists and why it is written as a no-op once upstream is right.

```
router.policyWhitelist(0x4F4678D4…) = false     <- what 0.8.0 exports
router.policyWhitelist(0xd6a42175…) = true      <- what 0.9.0 exports
```

`src/erc8183/addresses.ts` reads the struct from the SDK, overrides `.policy`,
and asserts `router.policyWhitelist(policy)` at startup — so the override becomes
a harmless no-op once upstream ships the fix, and the assert catches any future
drift either way.

### 5. The builders are the override seam — not the high-level functions

This cost us a failed transaction *after* the override in footgun 4 was already
in place. `hireErc8183Agent()` and `settleErc8183Job()` resolve contract
addresses through the SDK's own internal `erc8183Addresses(chainId)`. They do
**not** accept an addresses argument, so a corrected struct never reaches them.

**This is by design, not a bug.** The maintainer stated it plainly in
[altana-sdk #68](https://github.com/altananetwork/altana-sdk/pull/68): the
high-level functions bind to the bundled registry deliberately, and the
low-level builders are where you inject addresses. We found that the hard way
rather than from the docs, which is why it is recorded here — the seam is real
and correct once you know where it is:

```ts
// BINDS TO THE BUNDLED REGISTRY: uses the SDK's policy, reverts 0xc94463e3
await hireErc8183Agent(wallet, signer, params, { network: BNB_TESTNET });

// THE SEAM: buildHireCalls takes an explicit `addresses`
const calls = buildHireCalls({ addresses: erc8183For(97), jobId, provider, description, budget, expiredAt });
await client.execute({ wallet, signer, calls });
```

The lesson is unchanged and is the general one: asserting the value you *built*
proves nothing about the value the SDK *uses*. Assert, then make sure the
asserted value is actually on the wire.

### 6. Venus `markets()` returns seven words, and CF is not the liquidation threshold

Venus's Comptroller is a **Diamond on both chains** (mainnet included — it is not
the legacy Unitroller layout). `markets(vToken)` returns:

```
w0 isListed | w1 collateralFactor | w2 isVenus
w3 liquidationThreshold | w4 liquidationIncentive | w5,w6 reserved
```

Decoding it as the legacy `(bool,uint256,bool)` silently truncates and hands you
`collateralFactor` where you wanted `liquidationThreshold`. They differ in
practice — chain-56 vADA is CF 0.00 / LT 0.63; chain-97 vBNB is CF 0.70 / LT 0.80.
A health factor computed from `collateralFactor` is the *borrowing-power* ratio,
not the liquidation ratio, and understates safety. Using `liquidationThreshold`
reproduces `getAccountLiquidity()` exactly (verified to 4 dp on a live position).

`liquidationIncentiveMantissa()` does not exist on either chain — checked via
`facetAddress()` and by scanning all five facets' bytecode. The per-market
incentive is `w4` (`1.1e18` = a 10% liquidator bonus).

### 7. Two kernel behaviours found while building wallet-native hiring

- **Short-expiry jobs are rejected.** `createJob` with `expiredAt` ~75s out
  reverts with custom error `0xf7a0748c`; the kernel enforces a minimum job
  duration (our standard 3600s passes).
- **A plain EOA `settle` reverts — only the relay path lands.** Even from the
  provider address itself, `settle(uint256,bytes)` sent as an ordinary
  transaction reverts on both the router and the commerce contract; the same
  calldata through the relay (`client.execute` to the router) settles fine.
  See `apps/agents/src/scripts/settle_ids.ts`.

### 8. Two canonicalisation rules exist in the deliverable corpus

Every deliverable's keccak256 is stored on chain, and the hash depends on how a
non-ASCII character is encoded before hashing. Our corpus contains **both**
rules, split by *when the job was submitted*, not by what it contains:

| rule | encoding | jobs |
|---|---|---|
| `raw` | the character as UTF-8, what `JSON.stringify` emits | 748, 754, 757 |
| `escaped` | one `\uXXXX` per UTF-16 code unit (Python `ensure_ascii=True`) | 795, 796 |

Jobs 753, 765 and 797 are pure ASCII, so they reproduce under either.

The producer changed rule partway through the project. `apps/web/lib/verify.ts`
implemented `raw` only, and its header asserted that the single path was "proven
against all five deliverables". **That assertion was true and still useless**:
of the five published at the time, three predate the change and two are pure
ASCII, so the test set could not distinguish the rules at all. A green suite
proved nothing about the property it claimed.

It surfaced only when jobs 795 and 796 were recovered from chain and refused to
reproduce. Publishing them under the old assumption would have rendered a
**false MISMATCH** — the page telling a reader not to trust a deliverable that
is provably correct, which is strictly worse than publishing no manifest at all.

The fix has two halves, and the second is the one that matters:

1. Each deliverable records the rule it was hashed under; `manifestHash` takes
   it as an argument; the VERIFY block and its copy-paste reproduce command both
   state the rule they used, so the page cannot describe one rule and run
   another.
2. `apps/web/tests/deliverables-canon.test.mjs` asserts every deliverable
   reproduces under its declared rule **and that the non-ASCII ones fail under
   the other one**. Without that second assertion the per-job label decays into
   decoration the moment someone mislabels an entry.

If a hash depends on an encoding choice, a test set with no non-ASCII cases
cannot tell you the encoding is right. Add a case that fails under the wrong
rule, or you have not tested it.

### 9. Anything you await in the root layout prices the whole site

Two bugs of the same shape, one loud and one quiet. Both came from a single
`await` in `SiteFooter`, which `app/layout.tsx` renders on every page.

**The loud one: one `no-store` made every route dynamic.** The footer's LAST JOB
strip read the chain with `cache: 'no-store'`. An uncached fetch opts its route
out of static rendering, and because this one lives in the root layout, that was
*every* route. The symptoms did not point at the footer: twelve
`export const revalidate = 86400` declarations were silently inert, every page
served `x-vercel-cache: MISS` with `private, no-cache, no-store`, every request
paid a fresh server render, and the keepalive's "warm the cache" step warmed
nothing at all. The build output is where it shows: every page route was
`ƒ (Dynamic)` and should have been `○`/`●`.

**The quiet one: a 60-second default set the ceiling for the site.** With the
`no-store` removed, the first cacheable build reported a revalidate interval of
**1m for every route**. Nothing declares 1m. It came from `sbSelect`'s default
of `revalidate: 60` on one footer row read, because
[Next's rule](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) is that
a `fetch` with a lower `revalidate` than its route *lowers the whole route's
interval*. In the root layout, "the whole route" means all of them.

So the layout sets a ceiling nothing else can raise:

```
route declares          revalidate = 86400   (24h)
one footer fetch says   revalidate = 60      (1m)
the site gets                             -> 1m
```

The lesson is not "avoid no-store". It is that **the root layout is a global
config surface disguised as a component**. A fetch added there does not affect
one page, it re-prices every page, and neither symptom names the file
responsible — you find it by reading the build's route table, not the code that
looks wrong.

Both footer reads are now pinned to one shared constant.

## Considered and declined

### EIP-5792 batching — blocked upstream, not deferred

We looked at `wallet_sendCalls` to collapse the five hire transactions
(approve, createJob, registerJob, setBudget, fund) into one signature. The
tooling is not the obstacle: wagmi 3.7.7 already exports `useSendCalls`,
`useCapabilities`, `useCallsStatus` and `useWaitForCallsStatus`.

**The blocker is that the jobId does not exist until `createJob` executes.**
Three of the five calls take it, and a batch has to be built before any of it
runs, so a batched hire would have to assume `counter + 1` is ours — and lose
the race to another buyer funding between the read and the send. Lose it inside
an atomic batch and the whole hire reverts; lose it inside a non-atomic batch
and the budget and funds bind to somebody else's job.

The cost side is not compelling either, so this is not a close call waiting on
time:

- **A judge would be asked to change their account type mid-hire.** MetaMask
  reports `atomic: { status: "ready" }` for a plain EOA, which means it prompts
  the user to upgrade to a MetaMask smart account (EIP-7702) before it will
  batch. BNB Smart Chain Testnet is on its supported list, so this is the
  behaviour a judge would actually meet.
- **The gas saving is ~13%.** Measured from job 844: 626,231 gas across the five
  transactions; batching saves roughly four base transaction costs, about 84,000
  gas. At testnet gas prices that is noise.
- **The five-stage indicator collapses.** `wallet_sendCalls` returns one batch
  id and `wallet_getCallsStatus` reports batch-level status; EIP-5792 does not
  guarantee one receipt per call, so under atomic execution there is nothing to
  drive per-step progress. On a partial failure (status `600`) you learn that
  something landed, not which — you would re-derive it by reading `getJob` and
  matching the nonce, which is the code the batch was supposed to replace.

If the kernel ever exposes a job id the caller can compute in advance, the
blocker goes away and this is worth revisiting. Until then the sequential path
stays: it has completed a full wallet hire on chain, including recovery from a
stuck FUNDED job.

**Four of them return exactly 130 bytes — the ERC-1967 proxy stub.** The earlier
version of this table said only that every address "was verified with `cast
code`", directly under a warning never to take an address from documentation
without checking it has bytecode. Both halves were true and the pair was
misleading: a 130-byte answer proves a proxy is deployed at that address, not
that the logic you are about to call is behind it. The implementation column
resolves each proxy's ERC-1967 implementation slot and sizes what is actually
there.

Same shape as footgun 8: a check that passes without testing the property it
asserts. "It has bytecode" is not "it has the code you think"; the follow-through
is reading the implementation slot, and the failure mode of skipping it is
believing you verified something you did not.

The faucet pays **10 $U per address per 30 minutes**. A second `requestTokens()`
inside that window reverts with empty revert data (`0x`), which surfaces from
the SDK as `Rpc.ExecutionError ... Reason: 0x` at `prepareCalls` — a pre-flight
simulation failure, not a session-permission failure. Do not misread it as a
scope problem.

The tBNB gas dispenser's per-IP daily cap is keyed on `x-forwarded-for`, so
judges behind one NAT or a shared conference network share a single grant
between them; the sponsored path is the fallback when it refuses.

## Running things

```bash
# indexer
cd apps/indexer && npm run ingest && npm run stats

# agents
cd apps/agents && ALTANA_CHAIN=97 npm run retry
```

## Sweep runbook — what to re-run after a delta sweep

Data on the site comes from three places with **different staleness behaviour**.
Run every step; skipping the last one leaves a public asset silently wrong.

```bash
# 1. Extend the agent sweep from the stored cursor to current head
cd apps/indexer && npm run delta

# 2. Re-ingest the B402 Bazaar catalogue
npm run ingest

# 3. Re-enrich agents that have clients (needed, or agent_liveness_with_clients
#    inner-joins away the newly-live agents and the view disagrees with the stats)
npm run pass2

# 4. Recompute the fan-out curve and refresh registry_stats with a new
#    measured_at  (SQL: select * from public.refresh_fanout();  then upsert
#    registry_stats — see apps/indexer/sql/004_fanout.sql)

# 5. REGENERATE THE OG CARD — see below.
#    genog.mjs reads /tmp/og_stats.json, NOT Supabase. Dump it first or the
#    script dies with ENOENT.
curl -s "$SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/registry_stats?select=key,value,measured_at,note&order=key.asc" \
  -H "apikey: $SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY" -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY" \
  > /tmp/og_stats.json
cd apps/web && npx tsx genog.mjs

# 6. Redeploy. The card is a build asset; step 7 cannot update it.
git add app/opengraph-image.png app/twitter-image.png && git commit && git push

# 7. Push the new data to the live site
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $REVALIDATE_SECRET" \
  https://agensea-navy.vercel.app/api/revalidate

# 8. Verify by CONTENT — see below. Not deploy status, and not a local build.
#    Substitute the ceiling this sweep just wrote.
curl -s https://agensea-navy.vercel.app/docs | grep -c '341,288'
#    And confirm the served card IS the one you just built, by bytes:
curl -s https://agensea-navy.vercel.app/opengraph-image.png | shasum -a256
shasum -a256 apps/web/app/opengraph-image.png    # must match
```

### The OG card drifts silently — this is the one to remember

Every figure rendered in the app is read live from `registry_stats`, so it
cannot go stale. **`app/opengraph-image.png` is the exception**: it is a static
PNG baked from `registry_stats` at generation time, and it is what renders when
the URL is pasted into Discord, Twitter, Telegram or a submission form.

Nothing fails if you forget it. The site will be correct and the social card
will quietly show last week's numbers under a `measured …` date that no longer
matches. Treat `npx tsx genog.mjs` as part of the same checklist as
`/api/revalidate` — they are the two steps that publish data rather than compute
it, and only one of them is visible in the app.

A redeploy is required after regenerating: the card is a build asset, not an
ISR page, so `/api/revalidate` does **not** update it.

### Verify by content — and a local build is not content

The card above is the visible half of a general rule: **check what the deployed
site actually serves.** Not deploy status, not a green build. The case that
caught us was subtler than the card, because it looks exactly like verification.

`npm run build` locally does **not** give a faithful preview of any ISR page.
Next caches data fetches in `.next/cache/fetch-cache` keyed by the route's
`revalidate`, and `lib/queries.ts` reads `registry_stats` with `revalidate: DAY`.
So a local build replays whatever response was cached, for up to 24 hours,
regardless of what the database now says.

On 8 Sep this produced a prerendered `/docs` carrying the 31 Aug ceiling
(322,974) an hour after the sweep had written 341,288 — and silently omitted an
entire conditional block, because the `registry_stats` keys it tests for did not
exist when the cache entry was written. The build succeeded. Nothing warned. The
page looked verified and was a week stale.

```bash
rm -rf apps/web/.next/cache/fetch-cache   # before any build you intend to trust
```

**Vercel is unaffected** — its builds start from a clean data cache, which is why
the deployed site was correct throughout while the local build was wrong. That
asymmetry is the whole trap: the local build is the one that lies, and it is the
one you are tempted to believe because you just ran it.

### `refresh_fanout()` cannot be called through PostgREST

Step 4 says SQL and it means SQL. `POST /rest/v1/rpc/refresh_fanout` fails with:

```json
{"code":"21000","message":"DELETE requires a WHERE clause"}
```

The function opens with unqualified `delete from public.client_fanout;` and
`delete from public.agent_fanout_curve;`, and PostgREST connects as the
`authenticator` role, which carries:

```
authenticator => session_preload_libraries=supautils, safeupdate
               | statement_timeout=8s | lock_timeout=8s
```

`safeupdate` is preloaded per session, so it is in force inside the function
body too. Nothing in the SQL is wrong; adding `where true` to silence it would
be defeating a safety net rather than using the right door. Note the second
reason on that same line: `statement_timeout=8s` — a full curve rebuild over
109 clients has no business racing an 8-second budget either.

Run it from the Supabase SQL editor, `psql`, or an MCP `execute_sql`. Those
connect as a role without the preload, and it returns
`(clients_out, breakpoints_out)` in well under a second.

### `genog.mjs` reads a file nothing creates

The script takes its figures from `/tmp/og_stats.json`, not from Supabase. No
step in this runbook wrote that file, so a clean run died with:

```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/tmp/og_stats.json'
```

Step 5 above now dumps it. It must be the raw PostgREST array — the script
indexes it by `key` and reads `agents_minted.measured_at` for the `measured …`
date printed on the card.
