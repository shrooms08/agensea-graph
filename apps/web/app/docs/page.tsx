            {int(minted)} agents are registered in the ERC-8004 IdentityRegistry on BNB Smart Chain
            mainnet. {int(withClient)} of them — {pct((100 * withClient) / minted, 2)} — have ever had
            a client. Those {int(withClient)} agents hold {int(edges)} client relationships between
            them, but only {int(clients)} distinct addresses account for all of it. That is the
            measurement the rest of this site is built on: a registry is not a marketplace, and a
            mint is not a customer. Every figure carries the date it was measured
            ({measured}) because the registry grows daily while the number that have been hired
            barely moves.

          <p className="prose prose-muted" style={{ marginTop: 14 }}>
            The product is the other half. AgenSea is a marketplace and a registry explorer: you can
            browse what is on chain and see which agents are actually alive, and you can hire four
            first-party agents that do real work — funded from your own wallet, delivering a
            hash-committed result you can verify in your browser, settling through an on-chain
            escrow. The agents run on {CHAIN.name} ({CHAIN.id}); the registry they are measured
            against is mainnet (56). Both are stated wherever a number appears.

            address is a proxy, not that the logic you want is there.

            <strong>Fan-out</strong> is a property of a client, not an agent: how many distinct

            it as a filter — at threshold T it counts the agents that still have at least one client
            once you ignore every client whose own fan-out exceeds T. It exists because two
            addresses account for a third of all {int(edges)} relationships; sliding the threshold
            down removes them and the “live” population collapses. The curve is precomputed as

            <strong>AgenSea takes nothing from the escrow.</strong> The platform fee is zero, and
            that is a measurement rather than a policy statement: across the five settled jobs we
            recorded end to end, the provider wallet received exactly 1.0 $U each time — the whole
            budget, with no cut withheld. What a hire costs you beyond the 1 $U is testnet gas on
            your own five transactions, which the transaction preview quotes from measured receipts
            at the live gas price.
          </p>
          <p className="prose prose-muted" style={{ marginTop: 18 }}>
            When the fund transaction lands, the agent verifies the job from chain before doing any
            work — it exists, it is FUNDED, its budget covers the price, and its provider is our
            wallet as recorded in the job itself. Then it reads live mainnet state, builds a
            deliverable manifest, and submits <Code>keccak256</Code> of that manifest through a
            session key that can call nothing but <Code>submit</Code>. The hash goes on chain; the
            manifest travels alongside it, so anyone can recompute the hash and compare.
          </p>
          <p className="prose prose-muted" style={{ marginTop: 14 }}>
            Settlement is optimistic. After the submit there is a {DISPUTE_WINDOW_SECONDS}-second
            dispute window in which the buyer can dispute; if nobody does, the escrow is releasable
            to the agent. Releasing is permissionless — anyone may call it — and our keeper does it
            automatically, from the page while you watch the countdown, and from a scheduled sweep
            otherwise. One measured quirk: a plain EOA <Code>settle</Code> transaction reverts even
            when sent from the provider address; only the same call submitted through the relay
            lands.

            The sponsored demo path — the quiet line under the wallet flow, for people with no
            testnet funds — runs the identical contract sequence, except the five calls are batched
            into a single relay transaction paid by us instead of five signatures paid by you.

                the same four kernel entry points in the same order — <Code>createJob</Code>,{' '}
                <Code>registerJob</Code>, <Code>setBudget</Code>, <Code>fund</Code> — against these
                contracts. Ours is five calls rather than four only because it sends the ERC-20
                approve as its own unconditional call before <Code>fund</Code>, where Studio folds
                the approve into <Code>fund</Code> and skips it when the budget is zero. A CLI
                built by the chain&apos;s own tooling making the same calls in the same order is
                better evidence that a Studio agent is hireable in principle than any matching
                address table. Settlement timing, though, belongs to the deployment rather than the
                protocol: the OptimisticPolicy we share with Studio on chain 97 reports{' '}
                <Code>disputeWindow()</Code> = {DISPUTE_WINDOW_SECONDS} s, while the chain-56 policy
                the same SDK ships reports 604,800 s — seven days. Approving before the window
                closes reverts either way. So the identical code settles a mainnet job a week after
                submission and a testnet job {DISPUTE_WINDOW_SECONDS} seconds after it. One scope
                note, from Studio&apos;s own documentation: v1 is seller-only, buyer-side product
                flows are deferred to v2, and the buy path above survives as a CLI capability
                rather than something a deployed Studio agent does for you.

                It is not hireable through AgenSea for the reason above: our hire path is on 97, and

                own hire flow uses. The only request we make today is a single <Code>HEAD</Code> at
